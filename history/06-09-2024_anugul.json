The minimum temperature and relative humidity is favorable for out break of blast disease. To Manage Blast diseases first drain out excess water from the paddy field. Spray Hexaconazole @ 400-ml/acre or Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole @ 200-ml/acre or Tebuconazole + Trifloxystrobin @ 80-gram/acre. After receding of rain water there is chance of infestation Swarming Caterpillar in paddy . To manage this spray Chlorpyriphos 50 % + Cypermethrin 5 % EC @ 400-ml/acre or Lambda-cyhalothrin @ 400-ml/acre.
