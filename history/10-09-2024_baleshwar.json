To manage Bacterial Leaf Blight, organically mix 20-kg of fresh cow dung with 200 litres of water. Filter it with fine cloth and spray the solution in one acre. To manage this disease chemically, spray 200-gram Plantomycin along with Copper Oxy Chloride 50% WP @ 600-gram/acre. As the crop is in tillering stage maintain 2-3 cm of standing water in field.
