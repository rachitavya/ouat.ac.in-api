There is a chance of an increase in various disease infestation in both field and vegetable crops due to prevailing weather conditions so regular monitoring against these diseases should be advised. Farmers are advised to complete the sowing of Rabi crops like Mustard, Chickpea, Groundnut, Green gram/Black Gram etc. and start land preparation for nursery sowing of Rabi Paddy where irrigation facilities are available. Deworming and vaccination should be advised in animals to boost immunity and protect them from any harmful diseases.",

            "If rice is at maturity stage, stop irrigation in the field before harvesting. Since the weather is expected to remain dry in upcoming days then harvest the plants when 80-85% of the grains have matured and the plant looks pale yellow in color. After harvesting rice should be dried in the field for 2-3 days and thereafter threshing should be done. Rice should be stored at a moisture level of 12% in safe places. Due to low night temperature and high humidity there may be a chance of False Smut disease infestation in late maturing rice varieties so its regular monitoring should be advised. If infestation noticed, then spraying of Copper hydroxide 77% @ 2g/ltr or Tebuconazole 25% @ 2g/ltr should be advised. Repeat the spray after 7-10 days for its effective control."

Seven days after this treatment, 200g Rizobium culture and 3-4g sodium molybdate should be mixed in 10kg seeds in 400ml of water and mixed it thoroughly and dry it in shade for half an hour then go for sowing in the field. Seed should be sown with a seed rate of 8-10 kg/ac with a spacing of 30cm×10cm. Varieties: Green Gram: - Kamadeva, Durga, IPM 02 -3, IPM 02 -14, TARM1."

For 10 kg of seed, farmers can use 200 grams of rhizobium culture and 200 grams of phospho culture within 3 hours of sowing. 40 to 50 kg of seed or 60 to 70 kg of pod is required per acre. Seeds should be sown within 2 to 3 days of husking at a depth of 5 cm. If the seedlings are of 10 days old, it is recommended to conduct gap filling where the seedlings have not emerged."

Antibiotic treatment and consultation should be made with a qualified veterinary Doctor."
