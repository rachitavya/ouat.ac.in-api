   "general_advisory": "In paddy crop, Panicle initiation, Panicle emergence, flowering and milking stages are the critical stages. Cover the rows with dry leaves in Sugarcane. Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. The high temperature increases the water requirement of maize crop. Spread polythene in irrigation channels to save water wastage. High temperature in day hours may lead to wilting in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves around a coconut tree to reduce water loss. Cover with paper caps on the newly planted vegetable seedlings during the daytime. In shallow ponds, harvest fingerlings if water temperature rises.",
