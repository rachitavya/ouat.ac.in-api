Field preparation should be started for rabi crops. Bunds, channels, uncultivated fields and field roads should be cleaned, by removing weeds. Farmers are advised to transplant mature seedlings (35 -40 days old) of cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, tomato etc. in raised bed during clear weather. Regular surveillance work should be taken up in all crops in order to know the incidence of various insect pests and initiate the control strategies.",
