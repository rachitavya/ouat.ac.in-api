Apply balanced and appropriate fertilizers according to cropâ€™s growth stage. Install yellow sticky trap @ 8/acre to monitor sucking pest like White fly, Aphids, Jassids & Thirps in vegetables at vegetative stage. Rouging of viral infested plant should be done in vegetables. Infected plants should be uprooted and buried in the soil. After rouging, if infection is more, then spraying of Imidacloprid @ 1 ml per 3 -4 litres of water is advised to control the vector. Use pheromone trap @ 8/acre for monitoring borer insect in vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, cabbage, tomato etc.",
