   "general_advisory": "The district of Khordha may likely to receive very light to light rainfall for the next five days. Do proper field surveillance for pests and diseases regularly and take appropriate plant protection measures accordingly. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for infestation of sucking pests like aphid, jassids, whitefly, mealy bug, and thrips. Apply neem-based pesticide Azadiractin (1500 ppm) @ 3ml/liter of water at the initial stage to manage sucking pest infestation. Keep your crop field free from weed to minimize the incidence of diseases and pests. In uplands prepare seedlings for tomato and early variety cauliflower. For control Epilachna Beetle in cucurbits spray neem-based pesticide (Neem Oil 1500 PPM) @ 3-ml/liter of water at the early stage of infestation.",

            "BPH and WBPH Management: The high humid weather condition is favorable for Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) and White Backed Plant Hopper (WBPH) infestation in paddy. To manage BPH and WBPH in paddy avoid excess use of nitrogenous fertilizer. Do not keeping standing water in the field for a longer period. Alter the micro-climate of the rice field by alternate wetting and drying technique. Make alleys at 6 feet spacing for sunlight entry and proper aeration below the crop zone."
