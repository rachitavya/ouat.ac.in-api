If possible, cover young fruit plants by using sarkanda grass, dry corn stalks, or gunny sacks to cover small plants, keep the southeast side open to allow sunlight and airflow and apply light irrigation in field to maintain soil temperature. Vaccination should be avoided in animals during foggy days and cold wave period.",

The tablets should be wrapped in cotton pouches before placing them in the stacks. All the corners of the plastic cover should be plastered with 6-inch thick layer of mud/adhesive tapes to prevent leakage of gas. Minimum exposure period is for about 7-10 days."
