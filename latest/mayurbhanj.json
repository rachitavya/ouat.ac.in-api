In shallow lowland/ medium land transplanted rice, apply 35 kg urea/acre for HYV  and 42 kg of urea/acre for hybrids at tillering stage. In Zinc deficient soil, if Zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) has not been applied during final land preparation, spray Zn-EDT A @ 0.5 g/litre of water at 30 and 45 days after transplanting of rice or spray 0.5% ZnSO4 solution (2 kg ZnSO4 +10 kg of lime in 400 litres of water per acre) thrice at 15 daysâ€™  interval on appearance of deficiency symptom in the field. Maintain 2-3 cm standing water during tillering stage in paddy . if not applied earlier . Regular monitoring of the crop for incidence of pest and diseases should be done. Keep the animal sheds clean and dry . Provide suf ficient foods and water to animals and keep the foods in safer place to protect from rain.",

            "Due to prevailing wet and humid conditions the attack of pests like Yellow stem borer and leaf folder may increase in the crop. The present high humid weather condition and rainfall followed by clear sky is favourable for Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) and White Backed Plant Hopper (WBPH) infestation in paddy . To manage BPH and WBPH in paddy avoid excess use of nitrogenous fertilizer . Do not keeping standing water in the field for longer period. Alter the micro-climate of the rice field by alternate wetting and drying technique. Make alleys at 6 feet spacing for sunlight entry and proper aeration below the crop zone. If infestation of BPH occur (5-10 hoppers/hill), spray Neem Based Pesticide 1500 PPM @ 600-ml/acre at the base of the plant. If problem persists, spray Pymetrozine 50% WG @ 120 g/acre or Dinotefuran 20 % SG @ 80 g/acre or Flonicamid 50 % WG @ 60- gram/acre or Triflumezopyrim 10% SC @ 100 ml / acre at the base of the plant. Use only pesticides recommended for brown plant hopper at recommended dose only . To manage Leaf Folder and Case Worm pests in paddy spray Bifenthrin 10% EC @ 200 ml/acre or Lambda Cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 200-ml/acre or Fipronil 5% SC @ 400- ml/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60-ml /acre. Yellow stem borer management: To manage stem borer in paddy at early stage of crop, apply Cartap Hydrochloride 4%G @ 18.45-kg/ha or Chlorantraniliprole 0.4 % GR @ 10-kg/ha or Imidacloprid 0.3% G @ 15-kg/ha by mixing it with sand at 1:1 ratio. Leaf folder and case worm management: In paddy fields infested with leaf folder and case worm, apply mixture of 2.5-litre of kerosene and 50-kg of sand per ha and then move a string over the paddy crop by stretching at both the ends of the field. By this method the larva of insects falls to the water and gets killed. To manage Leaf Folder and Case Worm pests in paddy spray Fipronil 5% SC @ 1000-ml/ha or Profenophos 50% EC @ 1000-ml/ha or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 200-ml /ha. Bacterial Leaf Blight: To manage Bacterial Leaf Blight, spray Copper Hydroxide 53.8% DF 3g/ ltr or Copper Oxychloride 50%WP  3.0 g/ ltr . To manage Blast disease, spray Hexaconazole 5 % SC @ 400-ml/acre or Azoxystrobin 18.2% + Difenoconazole 1 1.4 % S.C @ 200-ml/acre or Tebuconazole 50%+ Trifloxystrobin 25 % WG @ 80-gram/acre. To manage sheath blight disease chemically spray Validamycin 3 % L  @ 400-ml/acre or Hexaconazole 5 % SC @ 400-ml/acre or Tebuconazole 50%+ Trifloxystrobin 25 % WG @ 80-gram/acre."

To manage the pest, remove the affected terminal shoot showing bore holes and the affected fruits. To manage this insect, install 8 nos. of pheromone trap having Leucin Lure per acre. Use chemical control if there is 4% withering of terminal shoot or 14% fruits infested with borers. For chemical control spray Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @ 80-gram/ acre or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % SC @80-ml/acre or Spinetoram 1 1.7 % SC @ 200-ml /acre.

The sand soaks the urine so that the animals can sleep over it comfortably . It is also easier to clean the faecal material over the sand floor . To keep the sand dry it is stirred upside down in 15-20 days interval.
