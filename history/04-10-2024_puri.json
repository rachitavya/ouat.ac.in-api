   "general_advisory": "Based on five days weather forecast received from IMD, farmers are advised to conduct agricultural operations like irrigation, spraying, intercultural operation, etc. with proper care. Sowing of green fodder should be advised in moist soil to avail proper diet to animals. Maintain about 5-10cm standing water during panicle initiation stage in paddy. Keep your crop field free from weed to minimize the incidence of diseases and pests. Farmers should avoid excess use of nitrogenous fertilizer at crops because it may extend the vegetative growth period and attract various insect pests. If the poultry bird is 3-4 weeks old, then go for vaccination against Ranikhet disease.",
