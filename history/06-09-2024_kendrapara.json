   "general_advisory": "Kendrapara district is likely to receive light to moderate rainfall for the next five days. Keeping rainfall forecast in mind farmers are advised not to do any type of spray and do proper drainage management in pulse crops and vegetable nurseries. After rainfall recedes apply top dressing of fertilizers either in transplanted or direct seeded rice. In case of transplanted rice in low/ medium land where top dressing of urea has not been applied, spray 2% urea after rainfall. There are chances of appearance of iron toxicity symptoms due to stagnant water. In such cases drain out stagnant water and apply 10-kg of MOP and Zinc Sulphate 21% per acre. Regular monitoring for occurrence of insects and diseases in crops is highly recommended.",
