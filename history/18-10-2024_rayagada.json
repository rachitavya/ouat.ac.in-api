Go for planting of vegetables like Carrot, radish, late onion, garlic, legumes, etc. October is the ideal time for hard pruning in rose to produce lots of flower buds on a well-spaced framework of branches. Go for nursery sowing of brinjal, tomato, cauliflower and sesame. Go for planting of cole crops. Cole crop seedlings are at 3-week stage in the nursery. Go for planting in the main field.
