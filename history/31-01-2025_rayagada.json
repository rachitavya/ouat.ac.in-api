To manage this pest, install 6-8 nos of light traps per acre. During primary stage of pest infestation spray neem-based pesticide @ 1-litre/acre by mixing in 200-litre of water. To manage this pest chemically spray Tolfenpyrad 15 % EC @ 400-ml/acre or Flubendiamide 20 % WG @ 20-gram/acre or Emamectin Benzoate 5 % SG @ 80-gram/acre by mixing in 200-litre of water."
