Before winter vaccination should be done for PPR and FMD in dairy animals. Dry weather to very light rain is expected in the coming five days. There is a possibility of root rot in vegetable crops after rains, so after the rains, soak the roots of these crops with 20 grams of metalaxyl and mancozeb and 1.5 grams of streptocycline per 1 liter of water.",
