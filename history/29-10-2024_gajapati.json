   "general_advisory": "The mean maximum daily temperature was 33.1°C and the mean minimum daily temperature was 23.3°C of the Gajapati district during the last week. The district received 04.7 mm of rainfall during the last week. Go for the sowing of pre-rabi crops like blackgram, greengram, horsegram, sesame, sunflower and cucurbits in up-medium land. Go for sowing of vegetable crops like Pea, carrot, radish etc. Harvest the crop when 80-85% of the grains are matured either manually by sickle or by using combine harvester or reaper . Paddy grains need to be sun-dried to 14% moisture content for consumption purpose and for seed purpose it should be dried to 12% moisture for better self-life. Harvest the matured maize and vegetables and keep it in safe place.",

         "advisory": [
            "The transplanted paddy is at flowering to grain maturity stage in the main field. The present high humid weather condition and rainfall followed by clear sky is favourable for Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) and White Backed Plant Hopper (WBPH) infestation in paddy. To manage BPH and WBPH in paddy avoid excess use of nitrogenous fertilizer. Do not keep standing water in the field for a longer period. Alter the micro-climate of the rice field by alternate wetting and drying technique. Make alleys at 6 feet spacing for sunlight entry and proper aeration below the crop zone. If infestation of BPH occurs (5-10 hoppers/hill), spray Neem Based Pesticide 1500 PPM @ 600-ml/acre at the base of the plant. If the problem persists, spray Pymetrozine 50% WG @ 120 g/acre or Dinotefuran 20 % SG @ 80 g/acre or Flonicamid 50 % WG @ 60-gram/acre or Triflumezopyrim 10% SC @ 100 ml / acre at the base of the plant. Use only pesticides recommended for brown plant hopper at recommended dose only. Warm, moist weather, low temperature (<28oC) favours Yellow stem borer. To manage stem borer in paddy at the early stage of the crop, apply Cartap Hydrochloride 4 % G @ 8-kg/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 0.4 % GR @ 4-kg/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC% @ 12gm/acre or Imidacloprid 0.3% GR @ 6-kg/acre by mixing it with sand at 1:1 ratio. Instead of this apply Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre. High humidity and high rainfall favour Leaf Folder and Caseworm pest. To control Leaf Folder and Caseworm pest biologically apply 2 no. of Trichogramma chilonis card per acre. In the field move a string over the paddy crop by stretching at both ends of the field. By this method, the larva of insects falls into the water and gets killed. To manage Leaf Folder and Case Worm pests in paddy spray Fipronil 5% SC @ 400-ml/acre or Profenophos 50% EC @ 400-ml/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60-ml /acre."
