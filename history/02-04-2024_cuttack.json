Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. Irrigate the maize crop to meet water requirements. Spread polythene in irrigation channels to save water wastage in sandy and loamy soil. Take preventive measures for high temperatures affecting tomato, brinjal, and coconut. Implement proper harvest management practices for onion. Control mango hoppers in mango orchards.",
