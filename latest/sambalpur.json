   "general_advisory": "There is a chance of occurrence of light to moderate rainfall along with thunderstorm and lightning between 10.09.2024 to 8.30 hours IST of 11.09.224, so farmers are advised to wait one more day for irrigation and spraying operation and keep their animal away from any electrical equipment. Drainage of excess water from crop field and storage of that water in nearby bund/pond for future use should be advised.",

            "Disease Management: After rainfall, there may be a chance of infestation of sheath blight and sheath rot disease in rice field. To control these diseases farmers should spray Trifloxystrobin 25% + Tebuconazole 50% WG @ 80 g or, Propiconazole 25% @ 200 ml or, Hexaconazole 5% SC @ 250 ml in 200 litres of water per acre. Repeat the spray at 7-10 daysâ€™ interval. Bacterial leaf blight attack is also observed in some field, so spraying of Copper Oxychloride 50% WP @ 600g and Streptocycline @ 30g in 200 liter of water per acre should be advised under clear and calm weather. Keep 3 pheromone traps per acre of rice field for monitoring the stem borer and leaf folder infestations. Whenever the number of male moths/trap reaches 4 or 5, apply Azadirachtin 0.15% EC @ 800 ml/acre or, Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR @ 4 kg/acre mixing with sand at 1:1 ratio or, spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre in 200 litres of water or, Cartap hydrochloride 4G @ 10 kg/acre or, Flubendiamide 20 WG 50 g/acre in 200 litres of water when sky is clear. Cloudy weather along with high humidity favor the gall midge attack in rice field and mostly observed in late sown crop. For its control farmers should spray thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 40g or Fipronil 5% SC @ 400 ml or Chloropyriphos 20 EC @ 500 ml in 200 liter water per acre in clear and calm weather condition."

In severe cases, the alternate spray of Spinosad 45 % SC @ 70ml and Emamectin benzoate @ 80 g per acre at 15 days interval should be advised. If sucking insect pest attack noticed, then spraying of thiamethoxam @ 0.2 g or imidacloprid @ 0.33 ml per liter of water should be advised. For controlling of some diseases like wilt, root rot etc. farmers should use Carbendazim @ 2g or copper oxicloride @ 3ml per liter water under no rainfall condition."
