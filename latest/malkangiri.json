Irrigate the nursery during morning and evening time. Go for sowing of pea, gram and green gram as paira crop fifteen days prior to harvest of paddy in low land. Keep your crop field free from weed and provide irrigation as per requirement by the crop. Feed animals with a mixture of green grass + hay + minerals + dry feed. Provide clean drinking water. Vaccinate animals against foot & mouth disease (FMD).",
