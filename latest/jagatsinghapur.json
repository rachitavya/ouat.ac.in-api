Maintain 2-3 cm standing water during tillering and 5-10cm standing water during panicle initiation stage. Remove the weeds and keep the field clean. There are chances of appearance of iron toxicity symptoms like lesser tillering, yellowing of leaves and stunted growth due to stagnant water. In such cases drain out stagnant water and apply 10-kg of MOP and 10-kg of Zinc Sulphate 21% per acre. Provide support to the standing crops damaged by lodging due to heavy rain. Due to the prevailing cloudy weather associated with high humidity, regular monitoring for occurrence of insects and diseases in crops is highly recommended.",
