After receding of rain water , the low temperature below 28°C and relative humidity more than 70% favours infestation of Swarming caterpillar and Yellow stem borer in rice. To manage Swarming caterpillar , first removes the weeds from the field and bunds. If crop is in Beushaning stage then complete Beushaning immediately . When the ETL  reaches ‚1 damaged tiller/hill or ‚2 larvae/ m2, spray Chlorpyriphos 50 % + Cypermethrin 5 % E.C @ 400-ml/acre or Quinalphos 20% E.C. + Cypermethrin 3% E.C. @ 400-ml/acre or or Lambda Cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 300 ml/acre during afternoon hours. To manage stem borer in paddy at early stage of crop, apply Cartap Hydrochloride 4 % G @ 8-kg/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 0.4 % GR @ 4-kg/acre or Imidacloprid 0.3% GR @ 6-kg/acre by mixing it with sand at 1:1 ratio."

To manage the pest, remove the affected terminal shoot showing bore holes and the affected fruits. To manage this insect, install 8 nos. of pheromone trap having Leucin Lure per acre. Use chemical control if there is 4% withering of terminal shoot or 14% fruits infested with borers. For chemical control spray Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @ 80-gram/ acre or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % SC @80-ml/acre or Spinetoram 11.7 % SC @ 200-ml /acre.

During this time please clean poultry houses every day and change the feed and water of poultry birds frequently. Don’t throw the dead poultry birds here and there. Please bury them by wearing gloves and masks and sanitise the place with bleaching powder. Don’t bring poultry birds or eggs to home from the affected area."
