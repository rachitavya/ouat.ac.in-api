High temperature in day hours may lead to wilting in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves. Cover vegetable seedlings. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds. Yellow stem borer management in paddy. Blast disease management. Tobacco caterpillar management. Early shoot borer management in sugarcane. Brinjal shoot and fruit borer management. Whitefly infestation in okra. Harvested onion storage.
