   "general_advisory": "Based on the above five days weather forecast received from IMD, farmers are advised to withhold irrigation and spraying of chemicals for the next 2 to 3 days. Protect the vegetable nursery of Chilli, tomato, onion, cole crops and brinjal etc. from rain by covering with plastic or polythene sheet. Harvest the matured vegetables & pulses and store in a safe place. Field preparation should be started for rabi crops. Bunds, channels, uncultivated fields and field roads should be cleaned, by removing weeds. Now is the suitable time for sowing mustard, sarson, sunflower, field pea, carrot, radish etc. So, farmers are advised to act accordingly. Pulses like lentil/black gram/green gram can be broadcasted in the standing matured crop (Rice) one week before harvesting to utilize the residual moisture in the soil in suitable areas. Farmers are advised to transplant mature seedlings (35 -40 days old) of cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, tomato etc. in raised bed during clear weather.",

If feasible, apply foliar spray of KNO3 @ 5g/litre of water or water soluble fertilizers like 13:0:45 at 5g/litre of water or 19:19:19 at 5g/litre of water to improve plants resistance to abiotic stress."
