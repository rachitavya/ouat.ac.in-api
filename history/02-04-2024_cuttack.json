Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. The high temperature increases the water requirement of maize crop. Spread polythene in irrigation channels to save water wastage in sandy and loamy soil. High temperature in day hours may lead to wilting in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves around a coconut tree to reduce water loss. Cover the newly planted vegetable seedlings during daytime. Harvest fingerlings if water temperature rises.",
