Seven days after this treatment, 200g Rizobium culture and 3 - 4g sodium molybdate should be mixed in 10kg seeds in 400ml of water and mixed it thoroughly and dry it in shade for half an hour then go for sowing in field. Seed should be sown with a seed rate of 8-10 kg/ac with a spacing of 30cm×10cm. Varieties: Green Gram: - Kamadeva, Durga, IPM 02-3, IPM 02-14, TARM1. Black Gram: - Prasada, Usala, PU 31, IPU2-43, Mahuri. Avoid irrigation for some days because some amount of rainfall is expected in the upcoming week."

Ensure seed treatment before sowing of seed and if possible, treat with bacteria or phospho culture 7 days after treatment. For 10 kg of seed, the farmer can use 200 grams of rhizobium culture and 200 grams of phospho culture within 3 hours of sowing. 40 to 50 kg of seed or 60 to 70 kg of pod is required per acre. Seeds should be sown within 2 to 3 days of husking at a depth of 5 cm. If the seedlings are of 10 days old, it is recommended to conduct gap filling where the seedlings have not emerged. Past weather condition is favorable for insect attack in groundnut crop so its regular monitoring should be advised."

Regular monitoring against the attack of Diamond back moth in cauliflower should be advised and if possible, farmers should use pheromone trap in the field for this purpose. If an attack is observed then spraying of neem oil @ 5 ml or Emamectin Benzoate @ 0.4 g per liter water should be advised after the occurrence of rain."

Don’t allow the urine or excreta to deposit around the shed which may lead to flies and make provision to restrict the entry of rainwater into the shed. Vaccination and deworming should be done to control different harmful diseases and stomach worms."
