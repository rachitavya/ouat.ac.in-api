Vaccination should be avoided in animals during foggy days and cold wave period. Farmers are advised to avoid burning of rice straw or crop residue in the field because it hampers the environment.",

            "After noticing the infestation of the stored grain insect pest, take up fumigation by using Aluminium phosphide tablets @ 3 tablets/ton grain in fairly airtight containers or by covering with thick tarpaulin leaving no gaps. Minimum exposure period is for about 7-10 days."

         "advisory": [
            "Seed treatment should be done with Carbendazim 50 WP or Trichoderma formulation. During cool winter days, a thin layer of well-decomposed FYM should be applied after sowing of seeds in a wet bed to keep the bed relatively warm. Preferably use bore well water for irrigation at evening and drain out the cold water at morning to maintain the soil temperature favorable for growth."

         "advisory": [
            "One hoeing and weeding operation should be advised in case of 15 to 20 days old crop. In case of dense planting, one thinning operation is advised to maintain optimum plant population. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for Aphid attack in mustard crop so regular monitoring against this insect should be advised."

            "Straw can be used as mulching material to maintain soil moisture as well as temperature in the field during the winter season. Harvesting of matured crops, as well as one light irrigation in crops which are in the vegetative growth stage, should be advised because dry weather is expected in the upcoming week."

            "Weak and sick animals should be covered with sack cloth to protect them from the cold. At the same time, during the night, all the animals should be kept in a covered shelter.",
            "Avoid keeping animals in a damp area, as well as protect them from smoke from fires which are lit to provide warmth. The dampness and smoke increase their chances of contracting pneumonia.",
            "To maintain the body temperature of animals, they should be fed with a mixture of oil cakes and jiggery including covering of body during cold hours. Pregnant animals (>6 months) should be given additional feed."
